## About me

Hello everyone. I have been interested in software development for more than 10 years. During this time, he managed to work in several companies. I have been developing software for the banking sector for the last three years. I really like to develop programs. My key programming language is JavaScript. I really like the concept of a functional and declarative approach to writing programs. To implement it, I use the React framework.
